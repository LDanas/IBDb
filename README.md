A Book Review CRUD App for people to login and logout, and for them to add their own books that they've read, that they can give a review of, write a description and so on. 

Nonetheless, here's a video of me testing the local MongoDB server:

I added some Notes for myself on how to start up the server, meaning, opening my backend repository, opening a node server.js there, going back to the main folder, opening up a git bash there and running the mongod there too.

I added the finishing touches for the "Edit" buttons, tested out the server if it all works, of course there are minor setbacks where I have to tweak some things, e.g. wanting the server to remember me in case I don't want to login again and instead would be redirected to the profile page again. Then there's the ratings, description tab, and so on. 

But nonetheless I am proud of what I achieved in the span of 15-20 hours, could be better, but we all start somewhere, so therefore this is a huge accomplishment for myself :)

Here's the video of me showcasing of what the App is about
